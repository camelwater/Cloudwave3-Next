## The Problem

Technology driven products and processes are redefining our society - making us more connected and more real-time; however, the fragmentation of the online life is obvious and our lives are segregated into silos - shopping, traveling, utilities, civil services and etc. even though the separation is well intended and creating an ecosystem which seems to have no single point of failure. 

The apparent silos, inconsistency and lacking of ground-up secure user identity management have created tremendous problems for both individual users and online entities, government, for-profit or non-profit entities along with their interaction with each other.


## The Solution

We plan a “multi-dimension” network, composing of these characteristics, distributed, transparent and auditable, which serves as the seamless layer between user and applications to facilitate three new types of relationships:

- Among individual citizens
- Between individuals and group entities
- Between individuals and intelligent machines & (ro)bots
    
## The First Wave of Application Implementation on the Network

- Freedom Dividend Coin
- Healthcare Services
- Hyper-Saving Shopping
- Ultra Cost Effective End User IoT Services

All of the apps will be available to download, starting with FDC and HSS, from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/) and [App Store](https://www.apple.com/ios/app-store/) at the end of March 2022.
